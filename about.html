            <p>Hi Hi I'm Claire Mcflurry, I'm a food blogger who travels from city to city and country to country ahring my foodiue experience. My love food started when i was still young, I would be in the kitchen with mommy and daddy( though daddy wasn't such a great cook as mommy was  &#128540;), my mom would cook up great and delish meals and that was when my love for food began.</p>
            <p>From there I was just a lover of the kitchen and I was just intrigued by how the mixing of ingredients could create an edible work of art. I also noticed how presentation played a huge role in making the food more attractive to the consumer and  basically that's how FOodie Fanatix came about . Now I travel city to city blogging about everything great and not so great in the dishes I come across. </p>
